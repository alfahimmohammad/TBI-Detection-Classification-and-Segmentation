# Detection, Classification, and Segmentation of Traumatic Brain Injuries

The ICH_detection_code folder contains codes for the detection and classification of Intracranial Haemorrhages. The RSNA ICH dataset from Kaggle must be downloaded to train and validate the models. The dataset to train and validate these models can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-intracranial-hemorrhage-detection/data.

For the codes in 3D UNet++ in Keras and ICH_3D_volumetric_segmentation_pytorch folders, the dataset can be downloaded from https://physionet.org/content/ct-ich/1.2.0/.
