# Detection, Classification, and Segmentation of Traumatic Brain Injuries

The ICH_detection_code folder contains codes for the detection and classification of Intracranial Haemorrhages. The dataset to train and validate these models can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-intracranial-hemorrhage-detection/data).

For the codes in 3D UNet++ in Keras and ICH_3D_volumetric_segmentation_pytorch folders, the dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://physionet.org/content/ct-ich/1.2.0/).

Please install the required libraries in a virtual environment by running

```pip install -r requiements.txt```
 
Please install Pytorch and its related dependencies to run the codes in Pytorch.
